## Routing
Introducing a new way to route express apps with file name convetions for simplicity and dynamic routing

A folder structure of `/espresso/[name]` will route to `/espresso/1` with **req.params.name**
```typescript
export const GET = (req: Req, res: Res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({
    message: "Tried to look for " + name,
    params: req.params,
  });
};
```
You can segment the routes as many times as you want, like `/espresso/[name]/[aroma]/[acidity]` and so on...

## Deploy
*I'll be working in a guide for deploying in many ways and usage with serveless and microservices*
